# popper2

This is a game of popping balloons. There will be  number of balloons
swirling around the screen and you need to clear all of them up. You
have a (small) number of bombs available, the count is tracked using
little red diamonds at the top left of the screen.

To set one off, click anywhere on the screen. If the explosion touches
a balloon, it will (in turn) explode. Explosions have a somewhat
random radius.

At this point, the game will be running on a fixed 800x600 grid.
